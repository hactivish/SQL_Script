We will be using Employees table to understand how a recursive CTE works. 
sql server query to display org chart 

Here is the recursive CTE that gets the organization hierarchy based on an EmployeeId. Notice that the recursive CTE has got 2 parts (Anchor & Recursive Member)
Declare @ID int;
Set @ID = 7;

WITH EmployeeCTE AS
(
     -- Anchor
     Select EmployeeId, EmployeeName, ManagerID
     From Employees
     Where EmployeeId = @ID
    
     UNION ALL
    
     -- Recursive Member
     Select Employees.EmployeeId , Employees.EmployeeName, Employees.ManagerID
     From Employees
     JOIN EmployeeCTE
     ON Employees.EmployeeId = EmployeeCTE.ManagerID
)

Select E1.EmployeeName, ISNULL(E2.EmployeeName, 'No Boss') as ManagerName
From EmployeeCTE E1
LEFT Join EmployeeCTE E2
ON E1.ManagerID = E2.EmployeeId

When David's EmployeeId is passed the query produces the following output
